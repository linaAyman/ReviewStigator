Almost 10 years ago, IXRF developed SEM-XRF microscope attachments allowing broader elemental analysis coverage. In 2014, IXRF launched our ATLAS series of general purpose, micro spot energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (microEDXRF) spectrometers for the measurement and mapping of elements from sodium (Na) through uranium (U).'
